Exception class

                                                                       Description

IOException                                                      This exception is raised when an input/output operation fails


SQLException

                                                                 This exception is raised when a database operation fails

ClassNotFoundException

                                                                 This exception is raised when a class cannot be found.

InstantiationException

                                                                 This exception is raised when an object cannot be instantiated.

NoSuchMethodException                                           This exception is raised when a method cannot be found.




Unchecked exceptions
The RuntimeException class is the superclass of all unchecked exceptions. The table below represents some of the commonly used unchecked exception classes in Java with their description.

                                                                              This is the superclass of all unchecked exceptions.


NullPointerException: 

                                                                              This exception is raised when a null value is used where an object is required.


ArithmeticException
                                                                              This exception is raised when an arithmetic operation fails.


ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

                                                                              This exception is raised when an array index is out of bounds.


IllegalArgumentException
ConcurrentModificationException                                               This exception is raised when a collection is modified while it is being iterated over.

The Error class represents the serious problems that cause the program to abort. They include out of memory error, stack overflow error, and so on. Now, let's see different types of errors in Java.



Error classes 

                                                                                Description

OutOfMemoryError

                                                                 This error is raised when the JVM runs out of memory.

StackOverflowError

                                                                 This error is raised when a stack overflow occurs.

VirtualMachineError

                                                                 This is the superclass of all errors that occur in the JVM.

AssertionError

                                                                  This error is raised when an assertion fails.
