[present inside java.util.pkg]
[collection framework]
------
collections is class--
[collections.sort]
[collections.suffle]
collection is an interface-------

collection[I]
child interface under collection 
List [I]                                        set[I]                                 queue[I]
child interface of collection             Insertion order is not preserved         
Insertion order is presevered             Duplicates are not allowed                   FIFO
duplicates are allowed
ArrayList[C]                              HashSet[C]                                priorityQueue[C]
LinkedList[C]                             LinkedHashSet[C]


MAP[I]
stores in the form of key and value pairs





ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
[here we can store any type of data]
to store particular data we can use Arraylist<String> al;
methods
[add(object)
 add(index,object)
 size()
 remove()
 get()
 set()
 contains()
 isEmpty() 
 addAll  ]


LinkedList - collection
duplicates are allowed, insertion order is preserved 
[if we have more number of retrival linkedlist is not recommanded] arraylist is preffered
insertion and deletion - linked is preffered
null values are allowed
we can addLast addFirst removeLast removefirst


--------set---
hashset
-duplicates are not allowed
-insertion order is not preserved
-hashcode
-different types data elements stored
-null supported
[searching will be faster in set]
